Students can apply for Special Projects funding from the Engineering Society for one-time purchases which benefit their organization or the Skule community as a whole. Purchases that are typically eligible for Special Projects Funding are:
- Tools, equipment, or instrumentsÂ (e.g. a drill press for use in club projects)
- Hosting a non-annual conference
- New ideas that are not a part of the typical EngSoc budget (e.g. Skule Kup in its first year)

Some examples of past Special Projects are:
- A new Suds fridge
- Tools for the Blue and Gold Committee
- Instruments for the Skule Orchestra and the LGMB
- Hosting the 2012 Ontario Engineering Competitions at the University of Toronto
- A rocket test stand for University of Toronto Aerospace Team

**Note:** Affiliated Clubs are also eligible to receive funding from EngSoc, see [Club Funding](/club-resources/club_funding) for more details.

**Total Funding Available for 2T4-2T5: $50,000**

 Please note that funding is approved on a first come, first serve basis.
