Affiliating a club with the Engineering Society makes it eligible for EngSoc funding and allows it to book resources such as rooms, AV equipment, or a barbecue. Clubs which have been affiliated in the past must apply for re-affiliation each year, while clubs which have not affiliated recently must apply for trial affiliation before transitioning to full affiliation after at least four months. Please read [the policy on club affiliation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/131fr_DDU6sE7p2DKIQtcqVucrNmtL5Ne) before submitting an application. Applications are always open!
