## Understanding GPAs
### GPA Terminology
There are three main types of GPA:
- The Sessional GPA (SGPA) is based on courses taken in a single session (Fall, Winter or Summer)
- The Annual GPA (AGPA) is based on courses taken in the Fall-Winter Sessions.
- The Cumulative GPA (CGPA) takes into account all courses taken for degree credit in the Faculty.

Generally, when referring to GPA, we are talking about your CGPA.

### How Important is your GPA?
The importance of your GPA is very dependent on your goals. When applying for internships in industry, some companies may not even ask for a GPA or transcript, while a few use it to help determine who gets an interview. However, once in an interview, it is generally your skills and experience that are most important. In general, GPA tends to be more important if you are applying for graduate school, scholarships or research positions.

## Grade Thresholds and Probation
There are three standings on probation:
1. **Clear.** This means that you may proceed to the subsequent semester.
2. **Proceeding on probation.** This is a warning that academic performance is not satisfactory.
3. **On repeat probation.** You are suspended for a year (ie. if you fail during semester 2S you, you must wait until next spring to re enroll in semester 2F). If you have a second instance of repeat probation you will be refused further registration, which means you are not eligible to continue studying engineering at UofT.

Your probationary status is determined based on your average each semester. This is a weighted average, where the weight of each grade corresponds to the number of credits associated with that course. Full year courses are not counted in your fall semester average, however, when calculating your winter semester average they are usually weighted twice as much as one-semester-courses (depending on the number of allocated credits).

### Grade Thresholds for First Year Students
The following are grade thresholds for first-year students.

### For the Fall Semester of First Year (1F):

<p id="footnote-1">[1] You will be placed on probation and may retake up to three courses.

<p id="footnote-2">[2] You must repeat specific courses (up to three courses) including all courses with an average below 50%. You may elect to retake a course between 50% and 59%. Repeated courses may be chosen by the First-Year Chair and T-Program Coordinator. </p>
<p id="footnote-3">[3] If you transfer to another program without space, you must get an average of 60% or greater in the winter semester in that program to remain in that program for the rest of your undergraduate degree. </p>

        <td colspan="3"> Doing good 🙂 You may proceed to the summer semester on probation in the T-program.  </td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### What is the T-Program?
The T-program is a program in the Engineering Faculty intended to help students struggling in first-year get back on their feet. The program allows you to retake three courses in 1W and defer three courses to the summer semester after first year.

### Grade Thresholds for Students in Second Year and Above
The following are grade thresholds for all non-first year engineering students.

        <td colspan="2"> You will be refused further registration. You are not eligible for re-admission. </td>
        <td colspan="2"> Proceed to the next semester on repeat probation. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

*Notes:*
* *Grade thresholds for EngSci students are the same as those for Core8 students after first-year*
* *For the purposes of probation lifting, a non-repeated semester means four or more non-repeated half-course equivalents*
* *Proceeding with a clear standing does **not** mean your transcript will be immediately wiped of all records of your probationary status. A record of your probationary status will remain on your transcript for the remainder of your undergrad.*
* *An academic standing of "Proceeding on Probation," or "On Repeat Probation" will be removed and changed to "Pass" (or "Honours" if applicable) upon graduation.*


## Honours Upon Graduation
There are two types of honours you can be awarded upon graduation: **high honours** and **honours**

To achieve **high honours upon graduation** you must:
1. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 87.5% or higher across courses taken in second, third and fourth year
2. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 82.5% or higher across courses taken in fourth year

To achieve **honours upon graduation** you must:
1. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 79.5% or higher across courses taken in second, third and fourth year
2. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 74.5% or higher across courses taken in fourth year

*Note: Summer courses are included when calculating cumulative weighted averages, however, “Extra” courses are not included.*
