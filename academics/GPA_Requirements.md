## Understanding GPAs
### GPA Terminology
There are three main types of GPA:

- The Sessional GPA (SGPA) is based on courses taken in a single session (Fall, Winter or Summer).
- The Annual GPA (AGPA) is based on courses taken in the Fall-Winter Sessions.
- The Cumulative GPA (CGPA) takes into account all courses taken for degree credit in the Faculty.

Generally, when referring to GPA, we are talking about your CGPA.

### GPA vs. Percentages
| **Grade as a Percentage** | **Letter Grade** | **Corresponding GPA** |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 90-100                    | A+               | 4.0                   |
| 85-89                     | A                | 4.0                   |
| 80-84                     | A-               | 3.7                   |
| 77-79                     | B+               | 3.3                   |
| 73-76                     | B                | 3.0                   |
| 70-72                     | B-               | 2.7                   |
| 67-69                     | C+               | 2.3                   |
| 63-66                     | C                | 2.0                   |
| 60-62                     | C-               | 1.7                   |
| 57-59                     | D+               | 1.3                   |
| 53-56                     | D                | 1.0                   |
| 50-52                     | D-               | 0.7                   |
| 0-49                      | F                | 0.0                   |

### How Important is your GPA?
The importance of your GPA is very dependent on your goals. When applying for internships in industry, some companies may not even ask for a GPA or transcript, while a few use it to help determine who gets an interview. However, once in an interview, it is generally your skills and experience that are most important. In general, GPA tends to be more important if you are applying for graduate school, scholarships or research positions.

## Grade Thresholds and Probation
There are three standings on probation:
1. **Clear.** This means that you may proceed to the subsequent semester.
2. **Proceeding on probation.** This is a warning that academic performance is not satisfactory.
3. **On repeat probation.** You are suspended for a year (ie. if you fail during semester 2S you, you must wait until next spring to re enroll in semester 2F). If you have a second instance of repeat probation you will be refused further registration, which means you are not eligible to continue studying engineering at UofT.

Your probationary status is determined based on your average each semester. This is a weighted average, where the weight of each grade corresponds to the number of credits associated with that course. Full year courses are not counted in your fall semester average, however, when calculating your winter semester average they are usually weighted twice as much as one-semester-courses (depending on the number of allocated credits).

## Honours Upon Graduation
There are two types of honours you can be awarded upon graduation: **high honours** and **honours upon graduation**.

1. To achieve **high honours upon graduation** you must:
- Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 87.5% or higher across courses taken in second, third and fourth year
- Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 82.5% or higher across courses taken in fourth year

2. To achieve **honours upon graduation** you must:
- Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 79.5% or higher across courses taken in second, third and fourth year
- Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 74.5% or higher across courses taken in fourth year

*Note: Summer courses are included when calculating cumulative weighted averages, however, “Extra” courses are not included.*
