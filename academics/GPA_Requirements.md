## Understanding GPAs
### GPA Terminology
There are three main types of GPA:
- The Sessional GPA (SGPA) is based on courses taken in a single session (Fall, Winter or Summer)
- The Annual GPA (AGPA) is based on courses taken in the Fall-Winter Sessions.
- The Cumulative GPA (CGPA) takes into account all courses taken for degree credit in the Faculty.

Generally, when referring to GPA, we are talking about your CGPA.

### How Important is your GPA?
The importance of your GPA is very dependent on your goals. When applying for internships in industry, some companies may not even ask for a GPA or transcript, while a few use it to help determine who gets an interview. However, once in an interview, it is generally your skills and experience that are most important. In general, GPA tends to be more important if you are applying for graduate school, scholarships or research positions.

## Grade Thresholds and Probation
There are three standings on probation:
1. **Clear.** This means that you may proceed to the subsequent semester.
2. **Proceeding on probation.** This is a warning that academic performance is not satisfactory.
3. **On repeat probation.** You are suspended for a year (ie. if you fail during semester 2S you, you must wait until next spring to re enroll in semester 2F). If you have a second instance of repeat probation you will be refused further registration, which means you are not eligible to continue studying engineering at UofT.

Your probationary status is determined based on your average each semester. This is a weighted average, where the weight of each grade corresponds to the number of credits associated with that course. Full year courses are not counted in your fall semester average, however, when calculating your winter semester average they are usually weighted twice as much as one-semester-courses (depending on the number of allocated credits).

### Grade Thresholds for First Year Students
The following are grade thresholds for first-year students.

### For the Fall Semester of First Year (1F):
<table>
    <tr id="YELLOW_HEADER">
        <th > Semester Average </th>
        <th> <45% </th>
        <th> 45%-50% </th>
        <th> 50%-55% </th>
        <th> 55%-60% </th>
        <th> 60%-79.5% </th>
        <th> >79.5 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align:top">
        <td id="YELLOW_COL"> <b> Core8 + TrackOne </b> </td>
        <td> You must withdraw from the program, you may apply again next year. Upon readmission you will be placed on repeat probation. </td>
        <td> You must withdraw and are eligible to retake the semester next year on probation </td>
        <td> If 3 or fewer courses are less than 50%, enroll in T-Program and repeat courses with marks less than 60% <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> 
            <br> <em> OR </em> <br> 
            Withdraw with the right to repeat next the semester next year on probation </td>
        <td> If all marks are greater than 50%, proceed to next semester on probation
            <br> <em> OR </em> <br>
            If 3 or fewer courses are less than 50%, enroll in the T-Program and repeat courses with marks less than 50% <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> 
            <br> <em> OR </em> <br>
            Withdraw with the right to repeat the semester next year on probation </td> 
        <td> Doing good 🙂 You have a clear academic record </td> 
        <td> You made the dean’s honours list 🙂 </td> 
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align:top">
        <td id="YELLOW_COL"> <b> EngSci </b> </td>
        <td>You must withdraw from the program. You may apply again next year for a different engineering program. Upon Readmission you will be placed on repeat probation</td>
        <td colspan="2"> You are placed on probation and required to transfer to a different program. You can either: <br>
            i.  Enroll in the T-Program and retake courses with marks less than 60%.
            <br> <em> OR </em> <br>
            ii. Withdraw from the Faculty with the right to return to a subsequent fall semester in a non-EngSci program with space. </td>
        <td> You are NOT placed on probation but must either: <br>
            i. Conditionally transfer to another Engineering program of choice <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> 
            <br> <em> OR </em> <br>
            ii. Transfer to another Engineering program with space </td>
        <td> Doing good 🙂 You have a clear academic record </td>
        <td> You made the dean’s honours list 🙂 </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p id="footnote-1">[1] You will be placed on probation and may retake up to three courses. If more than three courses have marks less than 60%, you normally repeat the three courses with the lowest grades.You are not eligible if you must repeat more than three courses or are a part-time student. </p>
<p id="footnote-2">[2] You must repeat specific courses (up to three courses) including all courses with an average below 50%. You may elect to retake a course between 50% and 59%. Repeated courses may be chosen by the First-Year Chair and T-Program Coordinator. </p>
<p id="footnote-3">[3] If you transfer to another program without space, you must get an average of 60% or greater in the winter semester in that program to remain in that program for the rest of your undergraduate degree. </p>

### For the Winter Semester of First Year (1W):

    <tr id=BLUE_HEADER>

        <td colspan="3"> You may apply for re-admission, if granted it will be on repeat probation. 
            <br>
            <b>This is also true if you have a mark of <50% in a repeated course.</b></td>
        <td colspan="3"> Doing good 🙂 You may proceed to the summer semester on probation in the T-program  </td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### What is the T-Program?
The T-program is a program in the Engineering Faculty intended to help students struggling in first-year get back on their feet. The program allows you to retake three courses in 1W and defer three courses to the summer semester after first year. For more details see [this link](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-2023-T-Program-Information-Sheet.pdf").

### Grade Thresholds for Students in Second Year and Above
The following are grade thresholds for all non-first year engineering students.

<table>
    <tr id=PURPLE_HEADER>
        <th class="background">
            Semester Average &rarr;<br><br>
            Current Academic Standing &darr;</th>

        <th>>79.5%</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="PURPLE_COL"><b>Clear academic standing (not on probation) </b></td>
        <td> You are placed on repeat probation, repeat this semester immediately when next offered </td>
        <td> You may proceed to the next semester on probation </td>
        <td> Doing good 🙂 You have a clear academic record </td>
        <td> You made the dean’s honours list 🙂 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="PURPLE_COL"><b> Proceeding on Probation </b></td>
        <td colspan="2"> You are placed on repeat probation, repeat this semester immediately when next offered </td>
        <td>Doing good 🙂You may proceed to the next semester with a clear standing</td>
        <td>You made the dean’s honours list 🙂You may proceed to the next semester with a clear standing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="PURPLE_COL"><b> Proceeding on Repeat Probation and/or repeating a semester </b></td>
        <td colspan="2"> You will be refused further registration. You are not eligible for re-admission </td>
        <td colspan="2"> Doing good 🙂You may proceed to the next semester on probation</td>
    </tr>
</table>

*Notes:*
* *Grade thresholds for EngSci students are the same as those for Core8 students after first-year*
* *Proceeding with a clear standing does **not** mean your transcript will be wiped of all records of your prbationary status.*

## Honours Upon Graduation
There are two types of honours you can be awarded upon graduation: **high honours** and **honours**

To achieve **high honours upon graduation** you must:
1. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 87.5% or higher across courses taken in second, third and fourth year
2. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 82.5% or higher across courses taken in fourth year

To achieve **honours upon graduation** you must:
1. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 79.5% or higher across courses taken in second, third and fourth year
2. Achieve a cumulative weighted average of 74.5% or higher across courses taken in fourth year

*Note: Summer courses are included when calculating cumulative weighted averages, however, “Extra” courses are not included.*
