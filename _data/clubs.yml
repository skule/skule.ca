  Club Description: "We host free weekly origami workshops on the U of T campus for\
    \ U of T students, staff, and alumni, as well as for anyone within the community\
    \ (not always University of Toronto students). We teach these workshops in order\
    \ to increase the appreciation for the art of paperfolding and to help others\
    \ hone their origami skills. Additionally, we collaborate with various other clubs\
    \ at U of T to host larger events, and have formed partnerships with many off-campus\
    \ organizations, including libraries and hospitals, to bring origami to the greater\
    \ community. \n\nOne of our core values is to be as inclusive as possible. As\
    \ such, our weekly workshops involve teaching various models at different, and\
    \ all difficulty levels, such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Our workshops\
    \ feature a variety of origami models, ranging from animals - such as penguins,\
    \ hummingbirds, sheep - to maple leaves and snowflakes, in addition to modular\
    \ origami, kusudamas, tessellations, and crease-pattern folding. In combination\
    \ with some of these monthly advanced workshops, we incorporate \"general\" workshops\
    \ that are holiday-themed, such as Halloween, Christmas, and Valentines, where\
    \ members can fold many simpler models within the one workshop. At no cost, we\
    \ aim to provide the U of T community with a comprehensive origami learning experience,\
    \ in efforts to build on members' origami skill and knowledge, and also, to ensure\
    \ that there is something within the scope of origami for everyone to enjoy."

    of 7 different teams, our workshops, and our yearly hackathon, we provide a broad
    range of opportunities for students to explore the multi-disciplinary aspects
    of robotics and find their passion. At UTRA, we build complex systems such as
    humanoid soccer-playing robots and autonomous rovers to heavy-duty combat robots
    to entry-level SUMO fighting robots. Every year, UTRA represents the University
    of Toronto in many prestigious national and international robotics competitions
    such as the RoboCup, Intelligent Ground Vehicles Competition, and the National
    Havoc Robot League. Our annual hackathon, UTRAHacks, draws in nearly 500 students
    from around the world to compete in North America’s largest robotics hackathon.

    easy, it is definitely a field that undergraduate students can be involved and
    excel in, especially with all the resources available to us at the University.
    In addition, the team aims to build sustainable space systems that would make
    it more feasible for humans to settle on extraterristrial planets. After all,
    WE might be the ones traveling there one day!
