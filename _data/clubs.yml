  Club Description: "We host free weekly origami workshops on the U of T campus for\
    \ U of T students, staff, and alumni, as well as for anyone within the community\
    \ (not always University of Toronto students). We teach these workshops in order\
    \ to increase the appreciation for the art of paperfolding and to help others\
    \ hone their origami skills. Additionally, we collaborate with various other clubs\
    \ at U of T to host larger events, and have formed partnerships with many off-campus\
    \ organizations, including libraries and hospitals, to bring origami to the greater\
    \ community. \n\nOne of our core values is to be as inclusive as possible. As\
    \ such, our weekly workshops involve teaching various models at different, and\
    \ all difficulty levels, such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Our workshops\
    \ feature a variety of origami models, ranging from animals - such as penguins,\
    \ hummingbirds, sheep - to maple leaves and snowflakes, in addition to modular\
    \ origami, kusudamas, tessellations, and crease-pattern folding. In combination\
    \ with some of these monthly advanced workshops, we incorporate \"general\" workshops\
    \ that are holiday-themed, such as Halloween, Christmas, and Valentines, where\
    \ members can fold many simpler models within the one workshop. At no cost, we\
    \ aim to provide the U of T community with a comprehensive origami learning experience,\
    \ in efforts to build on members' origami skill and knowledge, and also, to ensure\
    \ that there is something within the scope of origami for everyone to enjoy."
