If you would like to be further involved in the Engineering Society, you can apply to run for a position in EngSoc. Many positions in EngSoc are elected, including all of our Officers, Class Reps, and Board of Directors Reps, whereas our Project Directors are appointed via interview. In addition, there are many positions in Discipline Clubs and Ex-Officio groups that are also elected through EngSoc's elections process.

Of course, all members of EngSoc can vote in our elections, as well as their respective discipline clubs.

### Voting System

EngSoc's elections are conducted using a single transferrable voting system using the Gregory method, with a Droop quota. In English, this means that on your ballot, you rank your choices. Then, if the person you prefer the most doesn't win, your vote is transferred to the person you prefer the second most, then third most, and so on.

The process gets a little more complicated if there is more than one seat to fill. Here's the exact algorithm:

<p align=center>
<img src="./assets/stv-flowchart.drawio.png" alt="Count first preferences for each candidate. If any candidates have enough votes to be elected, elect them. Distribute the surplus of all newly elected candidates to remaining preferences, then start over if there are more seats to fill. If no candidate has enough votes to be elected, exclude the last placed candidate and distribute votes to remaining preferences, then start over."/>
</p>

#### Quota

The "quota" referred to above is how we make sure that at a majority of people don't have another candidate they prefer over the winner. The formula is:

$$\text{votes needed to win} = \lfloor\frac{\text{valid votes cast}}{\text{seats to fill} + 1}\rfloor + 1$$

So for example, if there is one seat to fill and 10 people voted, no candidate is allowed to win unless they have at least $\lfloor\frac{10}{1 + 1}\rfloor + 1 = 6$ votes. Likewise, for 10 people and two seats, each candidate needs at least 4 votes to win.

#### Vote transfers

As explained above, when a candidate is elected or eliminated, their votes are transferred to other candidates.

When a candidate is eliminated, the vote goes to the next usable candidate on the ballot instead. If there is no usable candidate remaining on the ballot, the vote goes to the "exhausted" or "non-transferrable" pile.

When a candidate is elected with more votes than necessary to win, the _surplus_ votes (that is, the number of votes above the quota they received) get transferred to each voter's next choice. However, because only the excess of the votes are being transferred, the votes are scaled down when being transferred.

The formula to determine the value transferred is:

$$\left(\frac{\text{total value of candidate's votes} - \text{quota}}{\text{total value of candidate's votes}}\right) \times \text{value of each vote when the candidate is elected}$$

For example: Say a candidate received 12 votes in the first round and the quota is 10. All 12 people who voted for this candidate would have their votes transferred to their second choice candidates at a value of $\left(\frac{12 - 10}{12}\right)\times1 = 0.2$
