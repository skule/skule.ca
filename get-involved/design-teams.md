> 
> Engineers In Action (EIA) - U of T Chapter is a multidisciplinary student club dedicated to raising awareness and making a positive impact in the world. Each year, we help bridge the gap of isolation in developing communities by designing and constructing pedestrian footbridges. This infrastructure plays a crucial role in connecting isolated communities to essential services such as healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Over the years, we have successfully completed bridge projects in Bolivia, Eswatini, and Guatemala. We offer the opportunity for students to travel to the build site, allowing them to contribute directly to the construction of the bridge during the summer months. Throughout the year, we also work to enrich student life through educational events, design workshops, and speaker series, allowing students to apply their education in meaningful ways. If you have any questions or would like to get involved, feel free to reach out to us at eia.uoft@gmail.com or follow us on Instagram (@eia.uoft).

>As humans, we've always gazed into the skies wondering what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. At the ISET, we believe it's time to reach beyond the stars.
As one of few undergraduate teams, our vision is to advance civilian life on Mars. With significant progress towards Martian colonization within the next decade, ISET aims to play a key role in tackling and innovating cutting-edge solutions towards difficulties associated with life on Mars. The team’s mission is to change perceptions of space design complexity by applying engineering principles at the undergraduate level to overcome challenges associated with interplanetary colonization.
The purpose of this team is to offer students at the University of Toronto an opportunity to design and prototype Martian systems.

This three-day event, held in Montreal, offers opportunities to network with industry professionals and students, as well as the chance to assemble and construct a  1-metre span bridge and test its strength under a hydraulic press.
Having won the competition three out of the last four years, UofT aims to continue its winning culture. To achieve this, we organize various workshops focused on design, modeling, and other relevant skills. Additionally, we provide guidance, materials, tools, and access to facilities necessary for each team to build their bridge.
The club welcomes all undergraduates and serves as an excellent platform to create connections while gaining experience in areas such as structural engineering, project management, and construction.

We cast the slipperiest of concretes, build the aerodynamicest of shells, and the brakiest of brakes to create a vehicle that barrels down snowy hills at speeds up to 74 km/hr. Another big part of tbog is team spirit – every team decides on a theme for costumes, toboggan decor, and a technical exhibition! We’ve done mailbog, IKEAbog, neanderbog, discobog, the list goes on… Anyone and everyone is welcome to join Tbog, with no commitment or skills required! Feel free to drop in for any of our build sessions – join our discord (https://dicsord.gg/vS22BzxU9q), and follow us on Instagram (@uoftbog) to keep up to date!
