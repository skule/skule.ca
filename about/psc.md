The Policies and Structures Committee (PSC) is an EngSoc subcommittee that meets once per month to discuss possible changes to EngSoc's Bylaws and policies. Topics that we discuss include revising the Constitution, Election Bylaws, and anything else that is relevant to the operations of the Engineering Society.

## What are Bylaws and Policies?

Bylaws regulate how EngSoc functions and how every entity of EngSoc operates throughout the year. Bylaws can only be passed, repealed, or amended by a majority vote of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the EngSoc Constitution (Bylaw 1) may only be amended by a two-thirds majority vote from an Annual General Meeting in which any full-time or part-time undergraduate engineering student is able to vote.Policies are a set of best practices for EngSoc. Policies can be passed, repealed, or amended by a majority vote of the Board of Directors, the General Meeting, or by a meeting of the Officers. For more information about EngSoc Bylaws and Policies, you can read [Bylaw 1 Chapter 7 - Amendments, Bylaws, and Policies](https://github.com/skule/bylaws/blob/master/Bylaw%201.pdf).

## What is the process of submitting changes to the Bylaws and Policies?

Whenever potential changes to the Bylaws and Policies are introduced, they are first sent to the Policies and Structures Committee for an initial review. While the PSC does not have any power to formally approve any changes in itself, it reviews the wording and the content of the suggested changes to ensure that they are equitable and representative of the engineering student body. After this initial review, the PSC creates a recommendation and passes it to the Board of Directors, who then vote on the recommendation. The recommendation is then approved or rejected by the Board or is sent back to the PSC for further review. 

## How can I be involved in the PSC?

If you are interested in the PSC or have any suggestions on how we can improve our Bylaws and Policies, feel free to contact the [PSC Chair](mailto:pscchair@skule.ca) or drop into a PSC meeting! The PSC meetings are always open to the public. If you would like to join the PSC as a member, nominations typically open in May and will be communicated to all students via the EngSoc Newsletter or email.
