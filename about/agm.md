The Engineering Society Annual General Meeting (AGM) is an open meeting where every EngSoc member is entitled to a vote; the Meeting serves to ratify changes to the Constitution over the past year, present the state of EngSoc finances, and appoint an Auditor for the next year, among other things.

In conjunction with the AGM is the Officers Accountability Meeting. The Accountability Meeting is where EngSoc Officers present their progress over the past half-year and accept any comments or feedback. This will follow the AGM in the same room.

If you have any questions about the Annual General Meeting, or the Accountability Meeting, please direct them to the Speaker at speaker@skule.ca or the Officer Team at engsoc@skule.ca.
