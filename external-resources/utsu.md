## Information for Clubs

### Recognition and Affiliation with the UTSU

The UTSU maintains a policy and mechanism for the recognizing of campus organizations. For the purpose of this policy, all such organizations, wishing to use "University of Toronto Students' Union" or "UTSU" in their names, and all groups wishing to access Union services and to participate in Union sponsored events, must first be recognized by the Union. Union "members" are defined as University of Toronto Students' Union (UTSU) members as outlined in UTSU By-Laws, unless otherwise specified. Campus club(s), group(s), and campus organization(s) are used interchangeably and only refer to St. George campus-recognized clubs.

### Can engineering clubs be recognized?

Yes! Engineering clubs can be recognized for the UTSU. Any club can apply for recognition. If a club fulfills both of the following two criteria, it will not be eligible for funding, but can be eligible for all of the other club services that are unique to the UTSU. If a club only fulfills one of the following, then it is eligible for all services including funding. An Engineering Club is any campus group that meets both of the following two criteria:
- More than half of the club's members are members of the Engineering Society.
- The club's primary purpose is, in the opinion of the Clubs Committee, to serve the needs and/or interests of members of the Engineering Society. Ambiguities in clubs primary purpose (ie. Engineering focused vs. non-Engineering focused) should be handled in favour of the club so that it receives funding from UTSU.
