CRO Ruling #1 may be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Lf8QqegVjrE-34rjUAlbCg5ebVq7bfb/view">here</a>, regarding the use of campaign that was made in visual and textual imitation of another candidate's material which was deemed not in the spirit of the election. As there are no provisions currently in the bylaws for this, no warnings or disqualifications will be issued, however, the creation and use of
campaign material similar to an existing campaign is hereby prohibited. <br> <br>Erika Narimatsu<br> Interim CRO
